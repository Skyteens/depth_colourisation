# Colourisation with depth estimate fusion
 
This project does colourisation of black and white images using the fusion of a despth estimate.

Feel free to use the google colab notebook to see the results.

Test images are from the COCO dataset, further training will be done to try improve quality of results

More information and data will be released later
